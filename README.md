# Just a twitter bookmark scraper

If you're like me, you like to save a lot of tweets to your bookmarks and never read them again, so I've made a Python script to collect the links into a nice CSV file so that I could back them up and work with them with other external tools.

It's probably not optimal, and it could do more things, and it uses Xpath to find the elements in the webpage do that means that every once in a while you'll need to change that Xpath to get the links, but it currently works.
